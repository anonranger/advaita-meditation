Advaita Philosophy means Non-Duality, the unity or oneness of the intelligent force, the holy spirit or Consciousness among all 
living beings. The philosophy says that all living beings are one undivided entity. The appearance of a reality in space and time is an 
illusion or Maya created by the mind. The labelling and division of objects as I, the subject and objects as separate beings is only 
an illusion or thought created by the mind. This is a 5000 year old philosophy and some of the well known proponents of the philosophy are
Sri Ramana Maharshi and Adi Sankara. The philosophical texts of Advaita are the Upanishads.

Advaita Meditation is a simple three step meditation practice, that helps one to realize the state of oneness in meditation.

Sit in a calm place and close your eyes. In a state of Meditation inquire with a simple question, Who am I? and slowly 
transition from Step 1 to Step 3. Try to stay to Step 3 for atleast 15-20 minutes.

**Step 1: Am the body?**

Imagine yourself lying in a burining pyre after death. Are you the body? What is that, which continues beyond the dealth of the body?

**Step 2: Am the mind?**

Are you the mind, that generates all the thoughts? Where was your mind created reality, the presence of I, in your deep sleep? 
The first thought the mind creates is the 'I, name and form' thought and all other subsequent thoughts come to serve the 
subjective  'I, name and form',thought. 

The function of mind is to create labels and divisions as I, the subject and others as objects as separate entities. When in reality, 
without the mind, there is no reality of space and time and no separation as subject and objects. You are one 
undivided consciousness.

**Step 3: I am Consciousness**

You are not the body or the mind. You are the breath awareness, the intelligent force or Consciousness that swells in your heart. If you
are Consciousness, then the living beings around are nothing but Consciousness, the undivided intelligent force. Consciousness is the true
source of happiness.

So treat others, like how you would like to be treated. Love, non violence and compassion towards another is your true nature.

From ignorance, lead me to truth;
From darkness, lead me to light;
From death, lead me to immortality
Om peace, peace, peace
