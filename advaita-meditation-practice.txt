**Advaita Meditation**

Advaita Meditation is a simple three step meditation practice inspired by the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi.Doing Meditation regularly is superior to reading tomes of books on the subject.

Sit in a calm place and close your eyes. Begin your meditation with a simple question, Who am I? and slowly transition from Step 1 to Step 3. Try to stay in Step 3 for atleast 15-20 minutes.

**Step 1: Am the body?**

Imagine yourself lying in a burning pyre after death. Are you the body? 

**Step 2: Am the mind?**

Are you the mind, that generates all the thoughts? All thoughts come to serve I, the imagination of who you are. When there is no I,ego your thoughts have no one to serve and then they die. 

**Step 3: I am Consciousness**

The breath-awareness that swells in your heart in a state of thoughtless mind is Consciousness.Consciousness is all that is.

If you are Consciousness, then the world around you is also Consciousness. Consciousness is all that is. Non violence and Love towards another being is your true nature.
